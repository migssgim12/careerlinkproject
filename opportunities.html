			<h2>From Hacks to Riches </h2>
				<p>We’ve shown that careers in coding can be very lucrative. Now we will show the path one takes to get those riches.</p>
			<h3>Training</h3>
<p> 1. Bachelor’s Degree </p>
        <p>The most common route for most coding jobs is a four-year degree at a university. According to O*net, 78% of Software developers and 43% of web developers start with a Bachelor’s. Locally Portland State University offers a degree in Computer Science.</p>
<br>
<p> 2. Associate's Degree </p>
        <p>According to O*net, 20% of web developers start out with an Associate's degree. This number is much lower in software development jobs. MHCC, PCC and CCC all have programs of study for web development. PCC and CCC offer AAOT in Computer Science (software development) and PCC and MHCC offer programs on Video Game Development.</p>
<br>
<p>3. Coding Bootcamps </p>       
        <p>Coding bootcamps have popped up all over the country and there are currently five housed here in Portland, along with many online options. The Portland schools mainly focus on Web Development, with a few exceptions teaching mobile applications and/or Java. The five bootcamps in Portland are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">Launch Code</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://pdxcodeguild.com/">PDX Code Guild</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">Code Fellows</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/">The Tech Academy</a></li>  
          </ul> 
<br>
<p>4. Teach Yo Self </p>       
        <p>The final way to become a developer is to teach yourself, either through online resources or books. This is probably the least-used option — but it has been known to happen. Only the very self-motivated can accomplish this task, but it is possible. If you can put together a portfolio showing your rock star coding skills, then the right employer won’t care about a lack of degree.</p>
    <h3>Finding the Job</h3>
    <p>There are many resources to finding jobs in the tech field. Sources common to all job fields, such as Craigslist, Monster, USAJobs and Worksource Oregon, work just as well in the Tech field. A great local source that gives links to other great resources is <a href="www.Portlandtech.org" <span> Portland Tech. (Click Link to view) </a> </span> It has listings for companies that hire in Oregon, organized by field, and even a page just for companies that hire at the entry level.

      <h3> Career Ladder</h3>
      <p> Entry level positions can differ depending on the field. Software developers are usually called Junior Developers and Web Developers are sometimes called Junior Web Developers. Other entry level titles are: Assistant Web Designer, Web Graphic Designer, Multimedia Designer,  and User Interface Designer. These also can have the Junior tag in front. </p>
